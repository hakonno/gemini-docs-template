# AI Agent Instructions

This file contains the central instructions for any AI agent working within this repository.

## Onboarding / Session Start

When starting a new development session, please follow these steps:

1.  **Read Your Core Directives:** First, read the `docs/README.md` file. It contains the rules for how you should read, update, and manage the entire `docs/` directory. This is your primary directive for documentation maintenance.
2.  **Gain Project Context:** After understanding the rules, read all the other files within the `docs/` directory. This will give you the full context of the project's architecture, key concepts, and current status.
3.  **Confirm Understanding:** Provide a brief, one-paragraph summary of the project's current state based on the documentation before we begin working.

You can use the following prompt to start a session:

> Please read `docs/README.md` to understand your core directives. Then, read all files in the `docs/` directory to gain full context of the project. Provide a brief summary of the project's current state before we begin.

## Task Completion / Session End

When a task is complete or at the end of a development session, you must update the project's documentation.

You can use the following prompt to end a session:

> Based on the work we just completed and everything we learned, please update the `docs/` directory. Follow all rules and heuristics defined in `docs/README.md` to ensure the documentation is accurate, concise, and well-organized.
